It makes me feel that they always had in them, I just wasn’t worth it. So because of this resentment, I have pulled back a lot. I don’t visit as much and when they call I hardly answer 99.5% of the time. The time I did go visit both my parents and siblings have all asked on separate occasions as to why they never really see me around anymore. When I’m asked this the excuse I often times go with is I’ve been busy with work and school. But really it’s because I’m painfully jealous that my siblings got a different childhood that I got.\n",
